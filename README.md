# Todo Expriements

This repository contains implementations of a dynamic to-do list component built in three popular frontend frameworks: Svelte, React, Vue and Lit.  Designed to show their syntax, reactivity models, and component structuring.
Each version of the component offers the following functionalities:

- **Adding New Todos**: Users can add tasks to their to-do list via an input field, either by pressing "Enter" or clicking an "Add Todo" button. Each task is added with a unique identifier and marked as incomplete by default.

- **Task Display and Management**: The to-do items are displayed in a list, with each task featuring a "Remove" button for deletion. Tasks can be marked as completed (e.g., a strike-through effect for completed tasks).

- **Interactive List Reordering**: Users can reorder tasks via drag-and-drop.

- **Accessibility Features**: The component supports keyboard interactions, allowing users to mark tasks as completed/incomplete without relying solely on mouse input.

- **Visual Feedback**: A reversed string of all task texts, updated as tasks are added or removed. This is to demonstrate how each framework reactively computes values.

I have used Astro to house them all.
